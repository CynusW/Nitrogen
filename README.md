# Examples

```
log("Hello world");
```
A simple hello world example. `log()` is stdout.

```
err("owo there was a fricky wicky");
```
Here `err();` is the stderr. This throws an error with `owo there was a fricky wicky`.

If statements:
```
let i = 0;
if (i) {
    log(i);
}
```
Here's how this works:
1. Declare `i` variable and set to 0
2. Ask if `i`. (yep)
3. print `i` (0)
